				Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring to and graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, 
				
				where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. 
				
				He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm called Berkshire Hathaway, 
				
				assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.
			
				Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970. He has been referred to as the "Oracle" or "Sage" of Omaha by global media.He is noted for his adherence to value investing, and his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.
				
				Buffett is a philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded The Giving Pledge in 2010 with Bill Gates, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.</p>

			<p><i>I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money... There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not what they're about."</i>
				â€”Steve Jobs</p>
